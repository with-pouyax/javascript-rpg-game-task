# RPG Game Task

## Task Description

Hey there! In this coding task, I'm working on an RPG game where each character's skills are determined by a value saved in their score.

- I've created a variable named `score` and set it to 8.
- Using `console.log()`, I'm printing "Mid-level skills:" and comparing the `score` variable to be above 0 and below 10 using the `&&` operator.

The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".

## Solution

You can check out the solution in the `game.js` file.
